# Cooperations & institutes

DESY operates within strong networks.

Global cooperation and close links with partners from all over the world are essential for cutting-edge research today. Each year, DESY’s unique facilities draw more than 3000 guest scientists from over 40 countries to Hamburg. To work as closely as possible with DESY, more and more institutions are establishing outstations on the campus itself.
