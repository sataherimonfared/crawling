## P23 experimental hutch


The beamline currently operates one experimental hutch with a heavy-load 5+2 circle HUBER diffractometer which can carry sample cells with up to 150 kg in horizontal scattering mode and up to 15 kg on an Eulerian cradle in the vertical mode. The instrumentation pool is aimed for multiscale analysis of nanostructured materials and devices. The available detectors include a state of the art 2 D LAMBDA pixel detector with Ga As sensor and a time resolution up to 2 k Hz. 
  
The hutch is temperature stabilized down to 0.10 and is equipped for operation with flammable and poisonous gases. A laser interlock will become available at the end of 2018.
