Neutrinos from the cosmos were observed for the first time in 2013 by the Ice Cube neutrino observatory. These elusive elementary particles with no electric charge and almost no mass can give us unique insights into the most violent processes in our universe. Astrophysical neutrino observations enable the new field of multi-messenger astronomy, where information from neutrinos and gravitational waves is combined with traditional multi-wavelength astronomy to enhance our understanding of supernova explosions, neutron star mergers, the formation of galaxy-scale relativistic matter jets, and many other phenomena. 
DESY hosts one of the largest groups worldwide in the Ice Cube experiment, which includes a dedicated Helmholtz Young Investigator group for multi-messenger astronomy. It is involved in the construction of the Ice Cube Upgrade and the preparations for the next-generation neutrino observatory Ice Cube-Gen 2. This next-gen observatory will also feature a novel technique to detect neutrinos by the radio emission produced in their interactions. DESY researchers develop and field test this new technology in Greenland as part of an international team.
