After the success of Ice Cube, especially at detecting neutrinos at the astrophysical energy frontier, eyes are pointed at even higher energies. At this energy frontier (1016 e V up to 1020 e V) neutrinos from the interaction of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in sources or with the cosmic microwave background are expected. In order to have a realistic chance of detecting those neutrinos, detectors of an effective volume of 100 times that of the already impressive 1 cubic kilometer of Ice Cube are needed. 
  
The international community is gearing up to start building a large radio array. Small pathfinder arrays like ARA and ARIANNA have shown technological feasibility. The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is first larger scale implementation of the radio technology. DESY plays a leading role in the software development, calibration and data analysis for RNO-G.
