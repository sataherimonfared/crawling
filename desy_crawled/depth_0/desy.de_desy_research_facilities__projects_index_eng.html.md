# Facilities & projects

DESY is one of the world’s leading accelerator centres.

The accelerators and detectors that DESY develops and builds are unique research tools. The facilities generate the world’s most intense X-ray light, accelerate particles to record energies and open new windows onto the universe. In addition, DESY scientists are involved in major international projects in particle and astroparticle physics.
