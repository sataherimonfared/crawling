# Innovation & technology transfer

DESY makes the knowledge gained from excellent basic research accessible and usable for society. The research centre actively promotes the transfer of ideas, knowledge and technology.

DESY’s Innovation & Technology Transfer (ITT) department is developing an ecosystem for innovation on the research campus in Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld. Cooperation with industrial companies is just as much part of it as supporting start-ups with all the expertise and resources of the research centre.
