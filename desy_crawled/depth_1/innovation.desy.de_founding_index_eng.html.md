# For founders

Basic research and entrepreneurship work well together

Business ideas and good business models: DESY researchers and engineers have a lot to offer in these areas. The DESY Start-up Office provides individual advice to founders and start-ups that offer high-tech products or services. You can rely on our strong network in Hamburg, Brandenburg, and beyond.

High-tech start-ups are demanding and products such as laser systems or detectors are highly complex, so it often takes a longer amount of time before business flourishes. This is why DESY's infrastructure and consulting services aim to transform this relatively long incubation period into healthy corporate growth.

### Entrepreneurship Lunch: Hamburg‘s financial support for start-ups

Annette Wurl and Pauline Gauthier will present the wide range of funding options available through IFB Innovationsstarter. 
The session is split into two tracks, covering Inno Founder and Inno Ramp Up/Inno Starter Funds. The event will be held in English and followed by a light lunch with time for networking.

### Offers for founders

From the initial idea phase to developing a business plan and securing funding, we are at your side to advise you as you build your own company. We also work with founders who have previous experience, not just first-time entrepreneurs.

For DESY employees, additional information is available in the "Guideline on support given to company spin-offs at DESY". The guideline applies to all start-up projects that are accepted into the "DESY Start-up Office Programme" and have at least one DESY employee in the start-up team."

Nobody can know how to do everything! But managing a company requires broad knowledge. So, we offer a wide range of events, workshops, and training courses to help you learn – from idea workshops to business model canvas workshops, and from training on how to pitch your idea all the way to export law.

We’ll help you determine which financing options are best for your start-up idea, from grants to venture capital. We will also support you in the application process.

Office and lab spaces

In the Innovation Village, special office, laboratory, workshop, and co-working areas are available to founders on start-up-friendly terms. And the planned Innovation Centre will further expand the infrastructure for start-ups and young companies on campus.

Our large network opens up many possibilities for start-up founders, including discussions with other founders, start-up events, and introductions to potential investors. We focus particularly on networking events that serve to connect various founders, such as the PIER Lunch Talk, Business meets Physics, HHIS, Hamburger Gründertag…

Prototyping in the workshops, use of lasers, quality assurance tests: on campus, your start-up can benefit from a multifaceted infrastructure during its first steps into the market.

#### Facilities

DESY as a start-up hub? Absolutely! In the planned Science City Bahrenfeld many things are coming together to make this new district attractive to young companies in the complex high-tech environment, including:

Science and research at the highest level

Access to the entire DESY research infrastructure and workshops

Attractive facilities and incubators with excellent work equipment

A vibrant network of like-minded people, including the University of Hamburg , clustered in an important center for research and teaching

The DESY Innovation Village was opened in mid-February 2019. It offers DESY start-ups office space, workshops, and laboratory space over approximately 1,000 square meters, embedded within the Bahrenfeld research campus. Until construction on the DESY Innovation Factory is completed, the DESY Innovation Village will be used primarily by start-ups. In the long term, other players in the field of innovation at DESY will also be located there, including project groups for the validation of new products and services or groups of employees in the start-up phase of their companies.

The Innovation Centre "Start-up Labs Hamburg" on the research campus is a joint project of DESY , the University of Hamburg and the City of Hamburg . From the end of 2020, the center will offer around 2,600 square meters of offices and laboratory space for founders and start-ups. It will be financed by the city of Hamburg. The center is being built next to the Centre for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL) . Young companies that arise from within research departments on the campus are embedded here in the attractive high-tech environment of DESY alongside several institutes of the university.

A centre for start-ups in the emerging fields of life sciences, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and new materials is being created.

The "DESY Innovation Factory" , a technology and start-up centre, is intended to identify innovations and business opportunities and make them available to society. The start-ups profit from the outstanding infrastructure of the Bahrenfeld research campus, from top-equipped laboratories and offices to tailor-made concepts for development.


"Startup Port" bundles the startup-supporting activities of DESY and nine other universities and research institutions in the Hamburg metropolitan region: The platform links online with offline and provides personal advice, resources and expertise of the participating institutions. Regardless of whether there is already a concrete start-up idea or simply an entrepreneurial spirit - Startup Port provides optimal support, coaching and networking.

# Focus on Start-ups

At DESY, new technologies are constantly being developed and existing technologies are constantly enhanced. If one of these technologies has the potential for commercial use, DESY researchers are free to set up their own companies and then acquire the license from DESY to use the technology. Some inventions are also developed by DESY employees in collaboration with companies, which then become licensees. Additionally, a company could acquire the license for a DESY innovation that it was not part of developing. In any case, companies can various ways to benefit from the technologies at DESY. Many have already done so and have built up successful businesses based on these technologies.

### Accelerated Muscle Biotechnologies (AMB)

Accelerated Muscle Biotechnologies (AMB) strives to provide access and support to small-angle X-ray diffraction experiments for muscle scientists around the world.

### X-Spectrum

The X-Spectrum team develops and produces high-end detectors for research - for use in highly complex experiments with X-rays.

### Cycle

Franz Kärtner is a professor of physics at the University of Hamburg and head of the Ultrafast Optics & X-rays group at DESY. He’s also the founder of a start-up. In 2015 he founded Cycle, but the idea for the technology has been on his mind for much longer. Franz started researching the basics during his time at MIT in the early 2000 s and founded his first spin-off company out of MIT in the USA with colleagues, but the market for the technology did not yet exist.
