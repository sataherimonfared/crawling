News from the DESY research centre

### Period

26/01/14 DESY to lead €18.4-Million “LEAPS ULTRAFAST” network to train the next generation of scientists for ultrafast science in Europe DESY is proud to announce that it will coordinate LEAPS ULTRAFAST, an ambitious new postdoctoral research and training programme funded through the European Commission’s Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) COFUND scheme. The LEAPS ULTRAFAST network will have a total budget of around 18,4 million euros, including 8,2 million in funding from the European Commission and approximately 10 million in co-funding contributed by all the consortium partners.

26/01/05 The Centre for Structural Systems Biology (CSSB) is under new scientific leadership this year. On 10 December 2025, the CSSB Council confirmed the Directorate’s nomination of Charlotte Uetrecht, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Lübeck, as the new CSSB Scientific Director for the coming two years.

25/12/15 Electron accelerator being cooled down to -271 °C after long improvement break After six months of maintenance and upgrades to the infrastructure, European XFELs accelerator is now being cooled again. A bath of liquid helium is being used to cool down the cavities in the 1.7-kilometre-long accelerator to -271 °C, just two degrees above absolute zero. At this temperature, the metal niobium is superconducting, enabling efficient energy transfer to the free electrons. In the summer of 2025, the accelerator was “defrosted”, i.e. returned to room temperature, for the first time in nine years of operation in order to allow for work that readies the facility to remain a leader in its field.

25/12/11 · Press-Release High-pressure and -temperature X-ray diffraction experiments indicate that seismic anomalies in the Earth's core could be due to chemical layering A research team led by the University of Münster has discovered new evidence of a layered structure in the Earth’s inner core. High-pressure experiments with iron alloys showed that seismic waves travel at different speeds depending on their direction. The findings could help explain long-standing seismic anomalies deep inside the Earth.

### An onion core: Researchers find hints of a multilayered centre of the Earth

A research team led by the University of Münster has discovered new evidence of a layered structure in the Earth’s inner core. High-pressure experiments with iron alloys showed that seismic waves travel at different speeds depending on their direction. The findings could help explain long-standing seismic anomalies deep inside the Earth.

25/12/05 Five-day camp a collaboration with Brandenburg education ministry The attendees of the Physics Camp at DESY in Zeuthen are heading home after five days, now with great enthusiasm and a visible thirst for knowledge. From 1 to 5 December, 14 teenagers from Brandenburg had the opportunity to gain a deep and practical view into world-class research. The Camp was organized in cooperation with the Brandenburg Ministry for Education, Youth, and Sport (MBJS) and was funded by the German federal state of Brandenburg. It is part of new student academy offerings made by the MBJS as part of a talent development programme, made possible through a three-year cooperation agreement between DESY and the Ministry that was signed last year. The Brandenburg Education Minister Steffen Freiberg took part in today’s closing ceremony and praised the engagement of the teenagers.
