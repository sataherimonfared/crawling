FLASH has been undergoing a significant upgrade with the FLASH 2020+ project, resulting in an externally seeded FLASH 1 free electron laser branch. The externally seeded operation at a high repetition rate, up to an effective repetition rate of 8 k Hz, positions FLASH at a unique place in the international FEL landscape. The increased longitudinal coherence, spectral stability, and high average spectral flux are ideal for advanced ultrafast and nonlinear X-ray probing of matter.

FLASH has started a process for community-driven experiments in the time interval after commissioning, before the start of normal peer-reviewed access mode. The experiments aim to demonstrate a particular capability of the new source, which is essential for your community.

In the AMO and condensed matter science areas, we have offered community experimental opportunities in the next couple of months. The community proposals have been created and will be staged over the coming months. The FLASH team will give an update of the expected parameters from the new machine for those two communities.

In addition, we will stage breakout sessions for the chemistry and biology community, which are more demanding in machine parameters and thus will be staged after the AMO and condensed matter proposals.

Satellite Workshop on Photon Diagnostics (XPD)


Location : European XFEL, Holzkoppel 4, 22869 Schenefeld

Photon diagnostics at X-ray Free-Electron Lasers is an essential ingredient for optimized machine performance and successful user experiments. The task of photon-diagnostics is to provide real-time information on critical beam properties, including beam position, transverse spatial profile, pulse energy, spectral distribution, polarization, wavefront, pulse arrival time, temporal profile and coherence. Operators rely on this data for machine tuning and performance monitoring. Instruments and users depend on these measurements for data analysis and sorting.

A diverse array of advanced instrumentation and techniques must be applied to achieve these objectives.Our methods include non-invasive, gas-based photo-emission devices, partially and fully invasive crystal-based techniques, and the use of Machine Learning algorithms. The instrumentation contains ultrahigh-vacuum components, fast electronics, and specialized sensors and detectors.

This workshop provides a dedicated platform to share the latest progress and innovations in photon diagnostics for X-ray beam characterization, and to identify opportunities for new collaborations. It will enable discussions on emerging novel methods and applications while providing an opportunity for operators and users to present their immediate needs and long-term requirements.

Ultrafast X-ray scattering with Large Pixel Detector: status and perspectives

Organizers : Dmitry Khakhulin (Eu XFEL), Hazem Yousef (Eu XFEL), Diana Bregenholt-Jakobsen (Eu XFEL), Maria Peter (Eu XFEL)

After over 8 years of operation the Femtosecond X-ray Experiments (FXE) instrument has accommodated a number of successful experiments using standard setups as well as installations under development. Approximately half of these experiments took advantage of the specially built MHz Large Pixel Detector (LPD) to perform femtosecond scattering and diffraction measurements at various conditions including (sub)MHz repetition rates, high energy photons and with signals requiring high dynamic range detection.

The range of experimental techniques employed at FXE using LPD currently comprises ultrafast Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) in solution, Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SFX) on proteins and small molecules, X-ray Powder Diffraction (XPD), and, recently, an attempt of Pair Distribution Function analysis (PDF). Such measurements enable pump-probe ultrafast studies on multiscale structural dynamics accompanying various fundamental processes such as photochemical reactions, phase transitions and collective lattice excitations in materials.

In the Satellite Workshop for Eu XFEL Users’ Meeting 2026 entitled “Ultrafast X-ray scattering at FXE with Large Pixel Detector: status and perspectives” we aim at presenting current instrument status, capabilities of LPD-based setups as well as recent results of relevant successful user experiments in order to inform and further attract targeted scientific communities. The second central goal of the Workshop is to collect and discuss specific experimental experiences and limitations at FXE as well as to initiate an exchange on potential improvements and developments addressing the most exciting scientific cases.

The event will conclude with a dedicated poster session, offering an opportunity to explore research highlights and engage with speakers and participants.

DIGITAL LEAPS Virtual Diagnostics Fully booked!

Draft Programme

Organizers : Raimund Kammering, Kai Tiedtke, Sergey Tomin

Time : Full day, 9-17:30

Building on the success of previous editions, this one-day collaborative workshop explores cutting-edge virtual diagnostics—leveraging modern computing techniques (AI/ML, high-fidelity simulations, and real-time data integration) to deepen our understanding and improving the operation of complex accelerator, synchrotron and FEL facilities.

Key topics include:

• AI-driven fidelity augmentation of photon and electron diagnostics (e.g., high-repetition-rate photoelectron spectra, streaking-cavity-based energy loss measurements).

• Full FEL/AI models as a foundation for virtual diagnostics, enabling rapid simulation of photon pulses and electron beam properties.

• Predictive machine learning for real-time photon pulse properties (e.g., in the time domain) using online diagnostic inputs.

• Integration of virtual diagnostics into machine operation, bridging simulations and experimental data for adaptive control.

• Automated pipelines for online analysis, from passive/active streaking cavity data to single-shot X-ray power profiles.

The workshop aims to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration among experts in accelerator physics, photon science, AI/ML, and diagnostics, to accelerate the deployment of virtual tools for existing and next-generation facilities.

Molecular dynamics at FLASH

Organizers : Markus Gühr (DESY)

Time : Afternoon 14-18:30

FLASH provides unique opportunities for the molecular science community by offering ultrashort X-ray pulses that span a broad energy range from the extreme ultraviolet to soft X-rays up to 900 e V. This radiation serves as a powerful probe for valence and core-level spectroscopy, enabling element- and site-specific investigations of molecules. In addition, the pulses serve to excite molecular dynamics via deep valence or core levels. When combined with synchronized optical lasers and THz sources, FLASH allows scientists to gain deep insights into the evolution of electronic structures during molecular processes.

Currently, established research communities at FLASH are exploring areas such as photo- and astrochemistry of gas-phase molecules, explore its limits at the few fs scale, perform fundamental studies in surface catalysis, and study molecules in liquid environments. Looking ahead, promising extensions into ground state chemistry, interfacial chemistry and biomolecular dynamics in ion traps are on the horizon, particularly considering the significant investments in the highly stable and coherent seeded FLASH 1 source.

The goal of this workshop is to connect FLASH scientists with researchers from the broader molecular user community, promote various ultrafast molecular techniques available at FLASH, and foster the exploration of new scientific approaches.
