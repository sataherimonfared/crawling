# We live Innovation

Today, essential research in the service of society is far more than just cutting-edge research alone.

According to the principle of Open Innovation, this essential research also includes the active transfer of technologies and knowledge, collaboration and cooperation with industry, and, last but not least, actively supporting company founders with all the expertise and resources our research center can provide. We actively shape the ecosystem – especially within the framework of Science City Bahrenfeld – in order to advance innovation. We’re modern, open-minded, curious, and service-oriented.

### Industry Satelite Meeting 2026 - supported by Hi-Acts

Hi-Acts and DESY Innovation & Technology Transfer invite you to the Industry & Science Meetup (ISM) on 28 January 2026. This event brings together key partners from industry, service providers, and the scientific community to exchange insights, deepen collaboration, and jointly shape our strategic direction for the years ahead. With keynotes on PETRA IV and Hi-Acts, interactive breakout sessions, and a company pitch session, the ISM offers an inspiring forum for dialogue, networking, and strengthening the innovation ecosystem.
