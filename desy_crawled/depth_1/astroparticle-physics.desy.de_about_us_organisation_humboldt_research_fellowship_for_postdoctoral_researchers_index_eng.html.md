A Humboldt Research Fellowship for postdoctoral researchers allows its fellows to carry out long-term research (6-24 months) in Germany. Applicants choose their own topic of research and their academic host. Humboldt Research Fellowships in the astroparticle physics

Colliding wind-induced gamma rays in binary systems (2017-2020) Humboldt Fellow: Dr. Jian Li Research Field: Particles with relativistic energies are produced in the shocks of interacting winds, which universally exist around stars. Among those, binary systems are known to be efficient particle accelerators, which are perfect laboratories to investigate particle accelerations and related high energy emissions. They provide access to different physical conditions on relatively short periodic time scale, which allows access to different conditions for efficient particle acceleration along orbit and chance to study repetitions and divergence from repetition. However, research gaps exist in our understanding of binary systems which hinder us from a unified view of particle acceleration and gamma-ray emission from colliding winds. In this project we aim to search for and measure the colliding wind-induced gamma rays from binary systems, study their coupling with shock related parameters, identify multi-wavelength correlations and explore unified conditions for launching colliding wind-induced gamma rays in binary systems. Through this project, we will push our understanding of particle acceleration and high energy emission of binary systems to a new frontier.
