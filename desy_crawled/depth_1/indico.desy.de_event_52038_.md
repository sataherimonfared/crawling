#### CFEL, Bldg. 99

We investigate photoacid-base proton exchange reaction dynamics in aqueous solution on ultrafast time scales with UV-IR and UV/soft-X-ray pump-probe spectroscopy. Using these novel spectroscopic methods we reveal remarkable aspects of the electronic structural dynamics of the proton donating photoacid, the accepting base, and on the nature of the hydrated proton while it resides on water, pointing us to the microscopic mechanisms of these elementary chemical reactions.

Coffee, tea and cake will be served at 1:45 pm.
