Supersymmetric quantum field theories with eight supercharges in dimensions 3–6 feature rich moduli spaces, with Higgs branches- often singular hyper-Kähler spaces- playing a central role. The framework of magnetic quivers provides a combinatorial tool to encode these geometries, while the decay and fission algorithm efficiently determines their phase structure and renormalization group (RG) flows through convex linear algebra techniques.

In this talk, I will present a unified perspective on quantum hyper-Kähler branches and RG flows in SCFTs across dimensions 3-6, focusing in particular on recent advances for three-dimensional N=3 Chern-Simons matter (CSM) theories. Utilizing Type IIB brane constructions, I will derive magnetic quivers that capture the maximal hyper-Kähler branches of both N=3 and N=4 CSM theories, including cases with non-trivial Chern–Simons levels beyond the reach of standard dualities. This yields a systematic characterization of their moduli spaces and RG flows.
