# Technology Offers

DESY continuously pushes the boundaries of what is technologically possible. The development, construction, and operation of large-scale research facilities require a high degree of precision, reliability, and stability. Basic research on these devices results in inventions, technologies, and processes that open up new solutions for production and analysis processes used in industry. Through targeted technology transfer, DESY makes its ideas and innovations available to industry and society and, together with stakeholders from science, society and industry, translates them into new applications to solve current and future challenges. DESY provides free capacities of its research facilities, grants licenses for the use of its technical solutions and generates new know-how in cooperations with companies.

# Success with DESY technology

At DESY, new technologies are constantly being developed and existing technologies are constantly enhanced. If one of these technologies has the potential for commercial use, DESY researchers are free to set up their own companies and then acquire the license from DESY to use the technology. Some inventions are also developed by DESY employees in collaboration with companies, which then become licensees. Additionally, a company could acquire the license for a DESY innovation that it was not part of developing. In any case, companies can various ways to benefit from the technologies at DESY. Many have already done so and have built up successful businesses based on these technologies.

### Lasers deflected using air

Using a novel method, beams of laser light can be deflected using air alone. An invisible grating made only of air is not only immune to damage from the laser light, but it also preserves the original quality of the beam.

### The ultimate positioning system

DESY and positioning specialist Steinmeyer Mechatronik want to transfer the prototype of the ultra-compact 6-axis positioning system EASy A 3 to series production for industrial applications.
