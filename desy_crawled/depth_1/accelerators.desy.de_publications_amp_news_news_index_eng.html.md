2025/12/15 Cold, colder, European XFEL After six months of maintenance and upgrades to the infrastructure, European XFELs accelerator is now being cooled again. A bath of liquid helium is being used to cool down the cavities in the 1.7-kilometre-long accelerator to -271 C, just two degrees above absolute zero. At this temperature, the metal niobium is superconducting, enabling efficient energy transfer to the free electrons. In the summer of 2025, the accelerator was “defrosted”, i.e. returned to room temperature, for the first time in nine years of operation in order to allow for work that readies the facility to remain a leader in its field.

2025/12/02 Towards tomorrow's energy supply Generating power through nuclear fusion – a new alliance that includes Hamburg wants to push forward research in this area. The shared goal is to build the world's first commercial fusion power plant in Germany, with cooperation between research and industry.

2025/11/06 Six DESY scientists awarded prestigious ERC Synergy Grants Synergies abound: six DESY scientists at the German research centre DESY in Hamburg have been awarded the highly competitive European Research Council (ERC) Synergy Grants for two ambitious research programmes. These grants are among the most prestigious offered in the European Union, recognizing outstanding scientific excellence and unique collaboration.

2025/11/05 Association of Friends and Sponsors of DESY honours outstanding young talent with thesis award The Association of Friends and Sponsors of DESY (VFFD) presented this year's thesis award to Ke Li and Benoît Richard during DESY DAY. The award, worth € 3000, recognises outstanding doctoral theses that make a special contribution to research at DESY.

2025/11/04 FLASH welcomes its first user groups after shutdown A new round of user experiments starts this week at DESY's free-electron laser FLASH. The first users are researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg.

2025/11/04 Lenses made of plasma open up new ultrafast applications Attosecond experiments – a Nobel Prize-winning area of research – may have gotten an additional boost thanks to a novel idea from the world of plasma accelerators. Pulses of light lasting a billionth of a billionth of a second drive attosecond experiments, which can track the movements of electrons. However, those pulses are notoriously difficult to focus. A team of scientists from DESY and the Max Born Institute (MBI) in Berlin has produced a new and flexible solution: Use a lens made of plasma, the highly energized state of matter found in lightning or on the surface of the sun. The resulting setup, described in Nature Photonics, not only focuses the attosecond pulses without significant absorption but also has a negligible effect on the duration of the pulses. The results potentially enable a wider range of attosecond experiments, which are useful in understanding the movement of electrons in novel and complex materials and elucidating the electronic roots of chemical reactions important for industrial and pharmaceutical processes.

2025/10/29 Hi-Acts remains on course for innovation The Helmholtz Association has decided to continue the Hi-Acts innovation platform (Helmholtz Innovation Platform for Accelerator-based Technologies and Solutions) on a permanent basis. Following a successful evaluation by an independent international committee, the project, which was launched in 2023 and initially funded for three years, will now be continued and thus anchored in the Helmholtz portfolio for the long term.

2025/10/28 Andreas Maier wins the 2025 Bjørn H. Wiik Prize He is one of the world's leading experts in the field of laser plasma acceleration: Andreas Maier, physicist, joined DESY in 2020, a lead scientist since 2022. Now he is being honoured with DESY's most important science award, the Bjørn H. Wiik Prize. An interview with the award winner:

2025/09/22 How to make great even better – European XFEL receives new electron source “GUN 5” The European XFEL, the world’s largest X-ray laser, is taking another leap forward. On 17 September, a brand-new electron source, known as “GUN 5.2”, was delivered to Hamburg after years of development and rigorous testing at DESY’s Photo Injector Test Facility (PITZ) in Zeuthen. During the current extended maintenance period, the source is being installed in the accelerator’s injector – a critical upgrade that will directly enhance the laser’s experimental capabilities.

2025/09/10 Rapid breakthrough: DESY team adjusts superconducting cavity with attosecond precision for the first time The word “precision” doesn’t do justice to the feat achieved by one of DESY’s accelerator groups: it has managed to adjust the acceleration in a TESLA-type superconducting resonator, or cavity, to within 190 attoseconds – an attosecond is a billionth of a billionth of a second! The demonstration, which has just been reported in the journal Physical Review Accelerators and Beams, is a milestone in the control of free-electron lasers (FELs) and could give a boost especially to ultrafast pump-probe experiments at FELs.

2025/09/01 Gymnastics for electron bunches Following a comprehensive 14-month upgrade as part of the FLASH 2020+ project, DESY’s free-electron laser FLASH is restarting – now offering new, unique capabilities for research on its FLASH 1 branch. Once scientific user operations resume, tailored, extremely stable and spectrally narrow X-ray pulses will be available for experiments. Combined with FLASH’s high repetition rate, this opens up entirely new opportunities for precise studies in biology, chemistry and materials science, with exceptionally high temporal resolution in the femtosecond range.

2025/08/21 Herwig Schopper: 1924-2025 DESY and the physics community mourn the loss of a great scientist, science manager, diplomat and visionary. The physicist and former DESY and CERN Director General Herwig Schopper passed away in Hamburg on 19 August at the age of 101.

2025/08/01 Maintenance break for the European XFEL For more than eight years, the temperature inside the European XFEL electron accelerator was minus 271 degrees Celsius – colder than in space. Now, for the first time, the accelerator has been slowly warmed up to room temperature for mandatory maintenance and extensive conversion work.

2025/07/30 DESY welcomes 100 summer students from all over the world DESY hosts 100 summer students from 33 countries - an international programme full of research projects, lectures, campus tours and culture. In Hamburg and Zeuthen, participants will experience first hand how cutting-edge research works and gain experience for their scientific future. Tours through tunnels and laboratories, networking events and excursions into the surrounding area make this summer an unforgettable experience.

2025/07/09 Students from Belgium, Canada, Mexico, Türkiye and the USA win the 12 th edition of Beamline for Schools Geneva, Hamburg and Bonn, 9 July 2025. Beamline for Schools (BL 4 S) is a physics competition that was initiated by CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, and is open to secondary school pupils from all around the world. Participants are invited to submit a proposal for a physics experiment to be undertaken at the beamline of a particle accelerator, either at CERN or at one of the partner institutes: DESY (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron in Hamburg, Germany) and ELSA (Elektronen-Stretcher-Anlage of the University of Bonn, Germany). In 2025, a record number of five winning teams have been chosen, based on both the scientific merit of their proposals and the communication merit of their submission video.

2025/07/03 New technologies for PETRA IV Large particle accelerators are extremely complex machines. At DESY’s X-ray source PETRA III, for instance, electrons travelling close to the speed of light are stored for many hours at a time.

2025/06/02 Gravity cavity It is quite common for research equipment to end up in display cases and exhibition rooms: discarded prototypes, particularly attractive particle detectors or innovative new developments help to explain science and are technological witnesses to the times. However, it is rather rare for exhibits to be dusted off and moved from the glass cabinet back into the research centre. At DESY, however, one such exhibit has recently begun its second life: a cavity (a cavity resonator that is actually used to accelerate particles) that was previously on display in Genoa is now to help find gravitational waves and axions.

2025/04/27 EPS Outreach Prize for Beamline for Schools The project “Beamline for Schools” has been turning high school students into temporary scientists for more than ten years. It’s a project of records and firsts: more than 20 000 students between the ages of 16 and 19 from all over the world have come in touch with it over the course of its existence. So far, 25 teams of students have actually performed their experiments at a real beamline at a real physics lab. The High Energy and Particle Physics Division of the European Physical Society EPS awards the project with this year’s EPS Outreach prize “for its original, innovative and successful outreach program of global competitions for high-school teams,” the EPS announced today.

2025/04/17 100 shots per second Laser-plasma accelerators can accelerate particles over distances that are up to 1000 times shorter than those required by conventional accelerators. The technology promises compact systems that have enormous potential to open up new applications for accelerators, for example in medicine or industry. However, the current prototypes have one drawback: most can only accelerate a few particle bunches per second – not enough for practical applications. DESY’s new flagship laser KALDERA has now made a decisive step forward: driving the compact plasma accelerator MAGMA, the innovative laser has shown to accelerate 100 particle bunches per second. This increased repetition rate opens the path to actively stabilise the plasma accelerator performance in the future which will bring it a good deal closer to first applications.
