# FOR INVENTORS

in·ven·tion /invention/ noun the act or process of inventing

The Innovation and Technology Transfer Unit  (ITT) advises and supports employees who have invented something. DESY researchers who believe that they have invented something in the course of their work should contact ITT as soon as possible in order to determine the potential of their ideas in a joint discussion, as well as to discuss possible opportunities and strategies.

We offer information, advice, and training on all strategic and operational issues relating to DESY's intellectual property: industrial property rights (patents, utility models, trademarks), copyrights, confidentiality agreements, and transfers of rights, for example through collaborative agreements or contracts with external partners.
