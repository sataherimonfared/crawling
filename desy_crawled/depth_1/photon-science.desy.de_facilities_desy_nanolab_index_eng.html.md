The DESY Nanolaboratory (Nano Lab) is operated by the DESY research group X-ray physics and nanoscience .

The methods available are complementary to the photon-based techniques at the DESY X-ray facilities PETRA III and FLASH and the European XFEL.


## ACCESS

Access to the DESY Nano Lab for scientific users is granted via

1. regular PETRA III or FLASH calls for proposals ( DOOR ). Once the combined proposal for the DESY Nano Lab and one of DESY's lightsources is accepted, access to DESY Nano Lab is scheduled prior, during or after the X-ray beamtime to ensure a successful and smooth experiment. A member of DESY Nano Lab will then assist in the proposed experiment or teach the user accordingly, depending on the complexity of the applied instrumentation and the user experience. Operation hours of the DESY Nano Lab are 8 am. to 5 pm. on working days.

2. DESY Innovation and Technology Transfer ( ITT ) for commercial users

3. cooperation with the research group X-ray physics and nanoscience

Any access request has to be submitted to Nano Lab@DESY.de to discuss the feasibility of the experiment.

## DESY NanoLab INSTRUMENTATION

The DESY Nano Lab is a facility providing access to:

spectroscopy and growth (UHV sample preparation chambers with LEED/AES, XPS, FT-IR, STM, MBE growth)

X-ray diffraction (reflectometer, six circle diffractometer, sample environments

microscopy and manipulation (AFM, STM, SEM FIB, EBSD, EDX tomography, Scanning Auger Electron microscope)

correlative microscopy with advanced marker technology

electrochemistry, dedicated chemistry lab, potentiostats, induction oven/gases, solid/liquid FT-IRRAS

nanostructuring (Litography, processing, FS-wide coordination)

clean room processing

Laser lab for the preparation of ultrafast pump-probe experiments in cooperation with Leibniz-Institut für Kristallzüchtung (IKZ)

magnetic characterization (physical properties measurement system, Kerr microscope)


## CONTACT AND FURTHER INFORMATION

The Nano Lab is situated at the Centre for X-ray and Nano Science (CXNS) close to the PETRA III Max-von-Laue Hall, allowing easy access and transfer possibilities. While most of the laboratories are situated at the CXNS, X-ray and electrochemistry labs are in close vicinity.
