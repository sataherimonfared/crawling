### A satellite event to the 2026 DESY/XFEL Photon Science Users' Meeting

With this workshop we aim to connect the photon science, storage ring, and FEL communities to explore advanced capabilities of state-of-the-art facilities and identify a path towards the next generation accelerator-based radiation sources. Recent advances in seeded FELs and FEL oscillators, as well as controlled and stable-state microbunching in storage rings, indicate a high potential of further improving longitudinal coherence in both linac-driven and ring-based sources and exploiting synergies between them. The workshop will have four tracks:

Advanced coherent generation schemes

Experimental techniques and science cases

Transverse and longitudinal coherence properties of undulator radiation

Intensity limitations and beam control

The workshop is being held as a satellite event to the 2026 DESY/XFEL Photon Science Users' Meeting. Link to the meeting agenda .

Scientific Program Committee: Gianluca Geloni (Eu XFEL) Eléonore Roussel (Univ. Lille) Miriam Brosi (KIT) Ryan Lindberg (ANL) Paul Goslawski (HZB) Markus Ries (HZB) Holger Schlarb (DESY) Florian Burkart (DESY) Proposals for contributions to the workshop can be addressed to any member of the Scientific Program Committee or directly to the local workshop organizers: Sergey Antipov (DESY) Ilya Agapov (DESY) Hans-Christian Wille (DESY) Ralf Röhlsberger (HI Jena)
