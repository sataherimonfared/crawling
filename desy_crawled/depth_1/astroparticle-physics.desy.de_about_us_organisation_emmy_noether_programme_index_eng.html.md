## Emmy Noether Programme

Director in charge of Astroparticle Physics

DESY Organisation

The Emmy Noether Programme by the German Research Foundation (DFG) gives exceptionally qualified early career researchers the chance to qualify for the post of professor at a university by leading an independent junior research group for a period of six years. Applicable are early career researchers in all disciplines, normally up to 4 years after completion of the doctorate. They need to show normally at least two years of postdoctoral experience and substantial international research experience. Emmy-Noether Groups in the astroparticle physics
