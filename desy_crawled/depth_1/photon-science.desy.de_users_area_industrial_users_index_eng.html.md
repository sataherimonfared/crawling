## Industrial Users

NFFA Europe welcomes industry and academia to conduct research at the nanoscale, offering free access to research infrastructures.

## Industry Services: Bright Light For Small Matter!

Analytical methods in conventional laboratories have their limits. When your research requires brighter light and the utmost precision for detecting chemical elements, or analysing environments within fluids, gases, amorphous solids, crystalline, or nanostructured materials, PETRA III – the world’s most brilliant synchrotron light source – and FLASH, the free-electron laser, are here to help. Additionally, the DESY Nano Lab, equipped with state-of-the-art flexible technology, can provide conducted at a beamline, down to the molecular and atomic levels.

DESY’s photon scientists and experts coordinate and execute research using photon science, offering industrial users the best possible experimental conditions to address a wide range of challenges – from materials science to life sciences and biotechnology. Our services include feasibility studies, the preparation and execution of measurements, and specialised data evaluation.
