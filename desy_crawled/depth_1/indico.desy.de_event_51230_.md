Native electrospray ionization (ESI) can produce gas-phase biomolecular ions and their complexes, but it is unclear whether their structures are indeed near-native. This lecture presents a synergistic approach combining ion mobility-mass spectrometry, gas-phase FRET, and microsolvation-based differential mobility to constrain molecular modeling. Applications include various peptides, revealing that only multi-method analysis yields reliable gas-phase structures.

Coffee, tea and cake will be served at 1:45 pm.
