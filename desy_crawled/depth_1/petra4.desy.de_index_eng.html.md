# Cutting-edge researchin a whole new light

A unique research instrument is to be built at DESY in Hamburg: the X-ray light source PETRA IV. Scientists from all over the world will conduct experiments here that can only be carried out at this facility. This will lead to a fundamentally new view of the world around us and a new quality of approaches for finding solutions to pressing questions in society.

## Research areas

Using the ultrabright X-ray light, researchers want to investigate natural phenomena and technical processes in new dimensions – from the millimetre range down to the nanoscale. 
PETRA IV will provide insights and knowledge and help to clarify urgent questions for the future:

### Healthcare

How can diseases be better tackled?

### New materials

How can we save resources?

### Energy

How can we make more resilient materials?

### New technologies

What do we need for the digital world of tomorrow?

### Earth and the environment

How do we preserve our ecosystems?

### Cultural heritage

How can we preserve our cultural treasures?

## News

Research topics and news about developments in the project


## Transfer and Innovation

Materials with special properties, new methods of energy storage, resource-saving agriculture or new, tailor-made medicines – PETRA IV will be the analytical tool that can enable the developments of such products and methods. This will allow companies to optimise processes, bring innovations to market faster and improve existing products.

## PETRA IV is to be built on the DESY campus in Hamburg-Bahrenfeld

The German Electron Synchrotron DESY has been operating its accelerator facilities there since 1959. For PETRA IV, the existing 2300-metre accelerator ring of the previous facility PETRA III will be modernised, and its instruments and infrastructure will be partially recycled.
