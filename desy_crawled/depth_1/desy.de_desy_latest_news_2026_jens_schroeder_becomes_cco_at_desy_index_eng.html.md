# Former GEO editor-in-chief Jens Schröder becomes Chief Communication Officer at DESY

Science journalist Jens Schröder has taken up the newly created position of Chief Communication Officer (CCO) at DESY on 1 January 2026. As CCO, Schröder, a proven expert in science communication and an experienced media manager, will head the Press and Communications group and further develop the strategic orientation of the research centre’s internal and external communication.

“Authentic science communication is more important than ever in today’s world of fake news and polarisation,” says Beate Heinemann, Chair of the DESY Board of Directors. “I am convinced that Jens Schröder, with his broad experience, will work with the entire team to take our research centre’s communications to a new level.”

Jens Schröder looks back on a career spanning more than 20 years in leading positions in science journalism. Most recently, he was self-employed as co-founder and co-managing director of “Studio Feynstein” and successfully produced podcasts (“Sag mal Du als Physiker” on Audible), book projects, and live shows.

Prior to that, he shaped German popular science reporting in various roles at the Gruner + Jahr publishing house, including as editor-in-chief of National Geographic Germany and the P.M. Group, as well as many years as head of GEO ’s science department and editor-in-chief of the entire GEO magazine family. Upon completing his Master of Arts degree in Bonn, Schröder had begun his journalistic career at the Henri Nannen School of Journalism in Hamburg, with stints at the Berliner Zeitung , the New York office of Stern and the Daily News newspaper in Durban, South Africa.

As CCO, Schröder will be closely involved in the strategic decisions of the DESY Board of Directors. “I was already fascinated by the research here as a journalist. I am delighted to now be able to become a real part of this fascinating world at DESY,” he says. “I have respect for the challenges of this change of role – but I bring with me some useful experience and a fresh outside perspective. I would like to contribute all of this to DESY.”
