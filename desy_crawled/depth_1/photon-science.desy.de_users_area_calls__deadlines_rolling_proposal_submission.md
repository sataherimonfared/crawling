### Allocation of beamtime and scheduling is done continously. Submission of proposals is possible at any time

Proposals for beamlines P 08, P 11, P 22, P 23 and P 24 can be exclusively submitted via the rolling procedure submission from now on. This procedure allows users to submit proposals at any time without deadline . Beamtime for incoming proposals can be allocated soon after submission if positively evaluated and requested by the applicant (i.e., after a few weeks of review and safety assessment). The system will also allow scheduling at a later stage if more preparation time is needed for the experiment. A key feature of this new model is the opportunity to distribute approved shifts into multiple beamtimes under the same proposal ID if multiple beamtime access is requested during submission. Users can submit: - proposals for up to 21 shifts (1 shift equals 8 h) for single or multiple beamtimes -	proposal for up to 72 shifts (for two years) (1 shift equals 8 h) and multiple beamtimes , but have to clearly delineate the need, use and distribution of shifts for proposals with more than 21 shifts. With these two options we replace former regular, BAG and LTP-type of proposals. Instead of former LTP proposals , a proposal with up to 72 shifts and multiple beamtimes should be submitted former BAG proposals , (i) each BAG collaborating group may now submit its own proposal with up to 21 shifts and multiple access, or (ii) a joint proposal with up to 72 shifts and multiple beamtimes should be submitted.

Proposals requesting more than 21 shifts need to be in line with the methodological and scientific strategic goals of the beamline and be of benefit also to other user groups . The proposers need to engage in a detailed discussion with the beamline staff prior to submission. For these proposals please use the proposal template for more than 21 shifts. The review comprises a mandatory presentation to the beamline responsible and PETRA management and will also consider the requirements mentioned before.

### India@DESY rolling accessto beamlines P08, P11, P22, P23 and P24

Indian users who wish to conduct experiments at the rolling access beamlines at PETRA III within the context of India@DESY may submit their proposals at any time. However, it was decided by the Indian partners that the Indian access is not organised in a rolling manner , i.e. all proposals submitted are collected and forwarded to India for review along with the regular call proposals after the deadlines in March and September. The result of the review can be expected in May and November, respectively. As soon as the results of the review are communicated, scheduling could be done if slots are available.

Current LTPs and BAGs accepted for these beamlines after earlier calls remain valid and will receive beamtime.

Instead of 


Following submission proposals will undergo a **technical assessment** by the beamline staff and **scientific review** by a pool of expert reviewers. All proposals will then be arranged into a stack based on their final ratings and scheduled according to the amount of available beamtime. Proposal not receiving beamtime within six months after review will be removed from the stack, submission of a new proposal is then required to get beamtime.
