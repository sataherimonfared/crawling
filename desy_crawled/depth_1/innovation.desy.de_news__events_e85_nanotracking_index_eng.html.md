# Nanotracking project launched: New technology for safe active ingredients and precise diagnostics

DESY, the University of Hamburg (UHH) and Axiom Insights Gmb H, a start-up founded by DESY, have jointly launched the Nanotracking project. The aim is to develop a novel technology that can be used to track drugs and nanoparticles precisely in the body – non-invasively, efficiently and with significantly less experimental effort.

Whether medicines, food or consumer goods – many of these products have an effect on the body at the molecular or nanotechnological level. This not only produces the desired effects, but also possible side effects, the causes of which could previously only be analysed with great effort. The nanotracking process aims to change this. At the heart of the project is an innovative imaging technique based on X-ray fluorescence (XFI). It enables labelled active substances, cells or nanoparticles in living organisms to be tracked precisely and simultaneously over longer periods of time – without the use of radioactive substances and with minimal exposure. Thanks to its high resolution and accuracy, it is possible to generate data that was not possible with previous methods. The project is divided into three development phases: 1. Professionalisation of synchrotron-based technology, which enables high-quality in vivo data to be obtained with significantly reduced effort. 2. Development of a compact, laser-plasma-based X-ray source, which will also enable applications in humans and allow broader use of the technology. 3. Establishment of an AI-supported data platform that can be used to prepare future studies and perform in silico simulations – a decisive step towards more efficient and forward-looking research approaches. The underlying technology was developed in close collaboration between DESY and the University of Hamburg and utilises the highly brilliant X-ray radiation from PETRA III at DESY. In addition, DESY and the University of Hamburg are working on compact laser plasma electron accelerators that can generate radiation properties similar to those of the synchrotron. The compactification of the X-ray source enables the scaling of applications that were developed and standardised at the synchrotron. This should make the process more widely accessible in the future. Nanotracking is making a decisive contribution to the development of safe and effective medicines – while also paving the way for more precise and resource-efficient research. The project is a prime example of how modern basic research, technological excellence and social responsibility go hand in hand. The project is funded by a grant from the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) until 31 December 2028.
