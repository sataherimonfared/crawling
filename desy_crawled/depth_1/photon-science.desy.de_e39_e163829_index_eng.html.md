[Preventing dangerous short circuits in lithium batteries](https://photon-science.desy.de/news__events/news__highlights/preventing_dangerous_short_circuits_in_lithium_batteries/index_eng.html) Dendrites are considered the most dangerous destroyers of lithium batteries — tiny metal structures that can cause short circuits. In the worst case, they can cause batteries to burn or explode. An investigation at DESY´s X-ray light source PETRA III has discovered that such structures can form not only at the electrodes but also in polymer-based electrolytes. This new finding by a research ... 
[New quasi-particle discovered in rare earth material](https://photon-science.desy.de/news__events/news__highlights/new_quasi_particle_discovered_in_rare_earth_material/index_eng.html) Electrons determine the properties of all materials: They decide whether a metal conducts electricity, how a semiconductor operates or which magnetic effects occur. In some materials, electrons behave in a particularly unusual way: They switch between different states, strongly influence one another and can even cause a metal to suddenly become an insulator – a substance that no longer conducts ... 
[Nanoscale under gigapressure](https://photon-science.desy.de/news__events/news__highlights/nanoscale_under_gigapressure/index_eng.html) Sometimes a change of perspective can make a world of difference.

[Developing irradiation-insensitive glasses through yielding](https://photon-science.desy.de/news__events/news__highlights/developing_irradiation_insensitive_glasses_through_yielding/index_eng.html) How do photons interact with amorphous materials? A collaboration between scientists from the group of ‘Disordered Systems’ at the University of Padua and DESY Photon Science has unveiled how glasses prepared using different methods respond to irradiation with hard X-rays. The simultaneous study of the structural, dynamic and thermodynamic modifications induced by photons suggests that X-rays ... 
[Discovery of a new class of bacterial enzymes](https://photon-science.desy.de/news__events/news__highlights/discovery_of_a_new_class_of_bacterial_enzymes/index_eng.html) Researchers at DESY Photon Science, together with international colleagues, have discovered a new class of enzymes that can be used to uncover previously unknown biological processes. The researchers suspect that these bacterial “di DNases” - the technical term - could play an important role in the immune defense of bacteria. The team recently published their findings in the renowned journal ... 
[A high-performance optical amplifier for microdevices](https://photon-science.desy.de/news__events/news__highlights/a_high_performance_optical_amplifier_for_microdevices/index_eng.html) Researchers at DESY Photon Science have developed a millimeter-sized high-power amplifier with an output power of more than one watt on silicon-based optical microchips. This output power is a many times higher than what was previously achievable on this tiny scale and enables the use of high-power on-chip amplifiers in the field of integrated photonics instead of external amplifiers. This would ...
