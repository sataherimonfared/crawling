You are kindly requested to register until 14 January 2026 (postponed deadline), which is obligatory if you plan to participate in the main sessions, workshops or to present a poster at the poster session.

The events comprise sessions on research with free-electron lasers (FELs) and synchrotron radiation sources, satellite workshops and scientific poster sessions in the afternoon, which will be accompanied by a vendor exhibition.

The scientific and the poster sessions of the DESY Photon Science users’ meeting take place on the DESY Campus (DESY Auditorium (Bldg. 5) | Poster sessions: CFEL Foyer (Bldg. 99)). The European XFEL poster session on Tuesday afternoon will take place on the European XFEL Campus in Schenefeld. Throughout the week, satellite workshops will also be organised at DESY and on the European XFEL Campus.

We are looking forward to welcoming users and all scientists who are interested in the use of photon sources for their research.
