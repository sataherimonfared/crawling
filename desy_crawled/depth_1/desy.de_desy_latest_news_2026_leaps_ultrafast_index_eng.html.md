# A whole new league

DESY to lead €18.4-Million “LEAPS ULTRAFAST” network to train the next generation of scientists for ultrafast science in Europe

DESY is proud to announce that it will coordinate LEAPS ULTRAFAST, an ambitious new postdoctoral research and training programme funded through the European Commission’s Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) COFUND scheme. The LEAPS ULTRAFAST network will have a total budget of around 18,4 million euros, including 8,2 million in funding from the European Commission and approximately 10 million in co-funding contributed by all the consortium partners. The scientific coordinator will be DESY scientist Andrea Trabattoni, in collaboration with Markus Gühr and strong support by Susanne Hummel and Annika Thies from the EU Office of DESY. Co-initiator and main partner is the Swiss Paul Scherrer Institute.

A European ecosystem built on world-leading light sources

Large-scale light sources, such as synchrotrons and free-electron lasers, and advanced laboratory-based systems are transformative tools for understanding matter at the smallest scales, both in terms of length and time. Europe stands at the forefront of this scientific domain, with nineteen photon science facilities collaborating under the League of Accelerator-based Photon Sources (LEAPS), supporting over 35,000 academic and industrial users per year. These facilities drive discoveries in fields like material science or chemistry, as well energy- and health-related research, linking fundamental research to technological and industrial innovation.

If Europe is to sustain its leading role in this research area, it needs both cutting-edge infrastructures and a highly skilled workforce capable of navigating the interdisciplinary landscape of modern light-source science. LEAPS ULTRAFAST directly addresses this need. The programme brings together eight leading institutions renowned for their contributions to ultrafast science and accelerator-based photon research:

DESY (DE) – Coordinator and main beneficiary

European XFEL (DE)

FELIX Laboratory (NL)

Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (DE)

MAX IV Laboratory (SE)

Paul Scherrer Institute PSI (CH)

SOLEIL Synchrotron (FR)

Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (ES)

Over five years, the network will award postdoctoral fellowships in six countries. Fellows will work on cutting-edge research projects with access to large-scale light facilities. The training programme will combine scientific excellence with personalised career development, equipping the LEAPS ULTRAFAST researchers with advanced technical expertise, transferable skills, and entrepreneurial competencies.

LEAPS ULTRAFAST makes use of the strong synergies among Europe’s foremost photon-science institutions to create a vibrant ecosystem for innovation, knowledge exchange, and talent development. With its comprehensive mentoring structure, supported by a dedicated cohort of supervisors and mentors, the programme is set to train fellows to become future leaders in academia, industry, and emerging technological sectors.

The first LEAPS ULTRAFAST call for fellow applications will be opened this year.
