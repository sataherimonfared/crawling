## PETRA IV: A discovery machine for uncharted scientific territory


A broad range of scientific disciplines benefit from these fast particles. Particle physicists bring them together in head-on collisions to investigate the tiniest building blocks of matter. Chemists, materials scientists and biologists use accelerators to generate the brightest X-ray radiation in the world in order to examine diverse materials ranging from aircraft turbines to microchip semiconductors and proteins that are essential to life. Medical researchers use accelerators for cancer therapy, as the high-energy particle beams can be targeted to destroy tumours.
Here, you will find the web pages of DESY’s Accelerator Division.
All accelerators function according to the same principle: Powerful electromagnetic waves accelerate the particles and massive magnets keep them on course. However, the accelerators’ specific technology varies according to the field of application. For the purposes of particle physics, accelerators must endow the particles with as much energy as feasible. Only then is it possible to generate and analyse the fundamental components of matter. An accelerator that functions as a light source, on the other hand, must induce the particles to emit extremely brief and intense flashes of X-rays.
The DESY experts can only expand their top position in the world ranking of accelerator centres by time and again breaking new technological ground. With the superconducting TESLA technology, DESY and its international partners have developed a pioneering accelerator concept that now forms the basis for two major facilities in the Hamburg region: the free-electron laser FLASH at DESY and the European XFEL X-ray laser, currently the most brilliant X-ray source in the world. Thanks to the superconducting technology, the repetition rate of the X-ray flashes and thus the average brilliance of the European XFEL are orders of magnitude higher than in other, normal-conducting facilities of this kind.
DESY is one of the forerunners of plasma wakefield acceleration – a revolutionary accelerator concept that enables up to a thousand times higher accelerating fields than conventional technology. It thus promises a new generation of powerful particle accelerators that could be built much more compactly than today’s facilities and could complement them in research, medicine and industry. In plasma accelerators, a laser or particle beam is used to generate a charged wave in a plasma that accelerates the subsequent particles. With the facilities LUX and KALDERA for laser-driven plasma acceleration and FLASHForward for the electron-beam-driven variant, DESY is pioneering developments in both directions, with the aim to realise mature plasma accelerators that can be deployed in its research areas in the future.
Complementing these core activities, DESY is pushing the frontiers of accelerator technology with various other facilities. The ARES linear accelerator enables accelerator research with ultrashort electron bunches for medical purposes and the development of autonomous accelerator methods. The AXSIS facility is used to explore terahertz-driven acceleration and its applications. At REGAE, the generation of ultrashort electron bunches is being advanced to perform time-resolved diffraction experiments on various materials. In Zeuthen, DESY operates the PITZ linear accelerator dedicated to the development of electron sources for the X-ray lasers of the future.
DESY operates one of the brightest storage ring X-ray radiation sources in the world.
