# Former GEO editor-in-chief Jens Schröder becomes Chief Communication Officer at DESY


“Authentic science communication is more important than ever in today’s world of fake news and polarisation,” says Beate Heinemann, Chair of the DESY Board of Directors. “I am convinced that Jens Schröder, with his broad experience, will work with the entire team to take our research centre’s communications to a new level.”
As CCO, Schröder will be closely involved in the strategic decisions of the DESY Board of Directors. “I was already fascinated by the research here as a journalist. I am delighted to now be able to become a real part of this fascinating world at DESY,” he says. “I have respect for the challenges of this change of role – but I bring with me some useful experience and a fresh outside perspective. I would like to contribute all of this to DESY.”
