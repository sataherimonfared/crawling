# Charlotte Uetrecht appointed new Scientific Director of CSSB


As head of the “Dynamics of Viral Structures” research group at CSSB, Uetrecht investigates the assembly of norovirus particles and replication complexes of coronaviruses. Her group explores the dynamic molecular machinery involved in the viral lifecycle and is interested in capturing short-lived or transient states therein that cannot be purified. To capture these transient states, the group uses state-of-the-art structural mass spectrometry (MS), an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, and is able to identify how individual proteins shuttle between larger molecular structures _._
Uetrecht takes over from Holger Sondermann (DESY, CAU) who has served as CSSB’s Scientific Director for the past two years and will continue to support CSSB as “out-going” Deputy Director. The management team will be completed by the new “in-coming” Deputy Director Tim Gilberger (BNITM).
